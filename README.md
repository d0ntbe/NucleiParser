# NucleiParser
Easy Parser For Nuclei Results


Without dependences... (dependences hater) 


If you have a lot of templetes for fuzzing - use it to find the BUGS. 

Input is: directory with files from Nuclei debug results for every template.
We write debug output and then analyze them all.

It works!
